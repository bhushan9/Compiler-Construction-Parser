<h2>How to run the code? </h2>
1. Extract the Phase2 folder in a working directory. <br>
2. Set src as the working directory using cd command. <br>
3. compile the scanner package using javac scanner/*.java <br>
4. compiler the parser package using javac parser/Parser.java <br>
5. Run Parser.java using java parser/Parser input_file.java. Where input_file.java is the name of test program. <br>

<h2>Implementation Methodology</h2>

The project uses the scanner which was provided by the TA. The tokens which are generated by the scanner are modified such that 
they can be used in a given grammar. Modification is such that "(" is tokenized as left_parenthesis and so on .We have gotten rid of token <meta statement> and <Spaces> as our grammar does not use them.
All the tokens generated are stored using an ArrayList in java and "EOF" is added at the end to signify the end of input stream. The arraylist in converted into String array for easy
access of individual tokens.
The parser is implemented using recursive descent parser with one function for each non terminal.
